                    Part name: DUBEC
                     Revision: 1.0
                   Board size: 38.875mm x 20.875mm
              Board thickness: 1.6mm
                   Board type: FOUR LAYER
       Outer copper thickness: 2 oz.
       Inner copper thickness: 2 oz.
Solder mask color (top & bot): WHITE
 Silkscreen color (top & bot): BLACK

No special instructions.

Design includes 0201 size SMT components, thus it
may be occasionally dense.

Functionality includes two DC-DC converters, thus
the 2 oz. copper thickness would be preferable (for
better electrical and thermal conductivity). If some
details are too small for 2 oz. thickness, 1 oz. may
be used.
